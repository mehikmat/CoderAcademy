Types of Messages:
 - We actually have three different methods of sending messages over computer networks.
 - Those methods are: unicast, multicast and broadcast.
 - Unicast:
   - When using unicast method, one device will send the message to exactly one destination device. 
 - Broadcast:
   - Broadcast is a packet that’s sent to all devices on specific network.
   - Routers don’t forward broadcast messages.
   - The router will receive the broadcast traffic, but it will not forward it through the router.
 - Multicast:
   - Multicasting identifies logical groups of computers. A single message can then be sent to the group.
   - Multicasting uses the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) to identify groups and group members.
   - Routers will also use IGMP to send messages to subnets that have group members.
   - Multicast groups are identified by special IP addresses between the range of 224.0.0.0 and 239.255.255.255.
   - Hosts can join and leave any group and can join to multiple groups.
   - MulticastSocket is used on the client-side to listen for packets that the server broadcasts to multiple clients.

Why Multicast:
 - Although point-to-point(unicast) communications are good for many applications, there are situations in which we need a different model.
 - For example, in a electronic conferencing system, there is a one-to-many conversation.
 - Although broadcast (ie. one-to-all communication) may serve for this purpose, its overhead is too large that make it an impractical solution.

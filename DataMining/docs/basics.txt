Data Mining System Classification
----------------------------------
A data mining system can be classified according to the following criteria:
- Database Technology
- Statistics
- Machine Learning
- Information Science
- Visualization
- Other Disciplines

Classification and Prediction
------------------------------
Two steps:
1. Classification --- Building the Classifier or Model
2. Prediction --- Using Classifier/Model for Classification/Prediction

Classification:
- This step is the learning step or the learning phase
- In this step the classification algorithms build the classifier
- The classifier is built from the training set made up of database tuples and their associated class labels.
- Each tuple that constitutes the training set is referred to as a category or class.
Classification Algorithms
- Bayesian Classification
- Rule-based Classification
- Genetic Algorithms
- Rough Set Approach
- Fuzzy Set Approaches

Prediction:
Use the classifier to predict the class for new unknown data


Decision Tree Induction
-----------------------
- A decision tree is a structure that includes a root node, branches, and leaf nodes.
- Each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch denotes the outcome of a test,
  and each leaf node holds a class label.

Bayesian Classification
